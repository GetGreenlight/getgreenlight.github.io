      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 10, 2025</p>

      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Greenlight mobile application and relay service ("Service") operated by David Farrell ("we", "us", "our"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>Greenlight is a notification and approval relay service for AI coding agents. It forwards permission requests from AI tools (such as Claude Code) to your mobile device, allowing you to approve or deny actions remotely. Greenlight does not execute commands, modify files, or control any AI agent directly.</p>

      <h2>2. Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You are responsible for every action you approve.</strong> When you tap "Allow" or "Always Allow", the AI agent will proceed with the requested action. You should review each request carefully before approving.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for configuring appropriate always-allow rules. Overly broad rules may result in actions being auto-approved that you did not intend.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for the security of your device. Anyone with access to your device can approve or deny requests on your behalf.</li>
        <li>You must not use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. No Affiliation</h2>
      <p>Greenlight is an independent product and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic, PBC or any other AI provider. "Claude Code" and "Claude" are trademarks of Anthropic, PBC.</p>

      <h2>4. Subscription and Payment</h2>
      <p>Greenlight may offer subscription-based access to the Service. Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions for in-app subscriptions. You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings. Refunds are handled by Apple in accordance with their refund policies.</p>

      <h2>5. Service Availability</h2>
      <p>We strive to keep the relay service available at all times, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted service. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, server issues, or circumstances beyond our control. If the relay server is unreachable, your AI agent's permission request will time out and the action will be denied by default.</p>

      <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DAVID FARRELL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.</strong></p>
      <p>Without limiting the foregoing, we are not liable for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any damage, data loss, or system changes resulting from actions you approved through the Service.</li>
        <li>Any damage resulting from actions auto-approved by always-allow rules you created.</li>
        <li>Any consequences of AI agent behavior, whether approved or not.</li>
        <li>Any damage caused by service interruptions, delays in notification delivery, or failure to deliver notifications.</li>
        <li>Any unauthorized access to your device or account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</strong></p>

      <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless David Farrell from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or any actions approved through the Service.</p>

      <h2>8. Assumption of Risk</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that AI coding agents can perform potentially destructive actions including but not limited to deleting files, modifying source code, executing system commands, and making network requests. By using the Service to approve such actions remotely, you assume all risk associated with those actions. You are solely responsible for maintaining appropriate backups and safeguards for your systems and data.</p>

      <h2>9. Account Termination</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, for any reason, including violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately.</p>

      <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
